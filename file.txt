Write a class that will represent a Card object including the following fields (data) and methods. 

Your object should have 2 fields:

an integer for rank (1-13 to represent the number, ace, jack, queen, or king) and
a String for suit (diamond, heart, club, spade).
You will write the following constructor and method:

public Card (int rank, String suit)
Constructs a new Card object with rank as the rank and suit as the suit.
public int compareRank (Card other)
Compares our rank to the other Card’s rank.
Returns a negative number if our rank is less than the other’s rank, 0 if our rank is equal to the other’s rank, or a positive number if our rank is greater than the other’s rank.
public boolean compareSuit (Card other)
Returns true if our suit is the same as the other Card’s suit and false otherwise.
public String toString()
Returns a String representation of our Card in the format of “rank suit”. For example, if we have a card representing the jack of spades is would return “11 spade”.
